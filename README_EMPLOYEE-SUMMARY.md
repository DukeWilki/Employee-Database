## Demo

## Design
The initial design is themed on 'The A-Team' TV series. This was acheived by using a camo background in the jumbotron, and personaising each employee card with a charachter from the A-Team. Using pop culture references in team building can help build team comoraderie. This initail theme could eventually be built to include other teams (X-Men, Smurfs, LOTR etc) which could be manually selected or randomly assigned.
